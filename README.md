## Function
The blood cell classifier is a convolutional neural network that classifies immages of blood cells as either neutrophils, eosinophils, or basophils. Training data can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zIOERKTgTAp43SMS4xP-KYVCwbH-r3PV?usp=drive_link). The classifier can be run in jupyter notebook or google colab.
